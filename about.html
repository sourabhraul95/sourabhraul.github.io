          Hello there! I’m <strong>Sourabh Raul</strong>, a results-driven SEO specialist and digital marketer based in Liverpool.
          With over <strong>5 years</strong> of professional experience in SEO and a strong academic foundation, I’m passionate about
          helping brands grow their organic presence by combining technical expertise with clear, customer-first strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          My academic journey has been marked by excellence with an <strong>MSc in Digital Marketing</strong> from Liverpool John Moores University,
          which strengthened the way I connect marketing theory with real-world performance and ROI.
        </p>

        <p>
          My work focuses on building end-to-end SEO strategies that improve rankings, increase organic traffic, and support business growth.
          I’m experienced across <strong>Technical SEO</strong>, <strong>On-Page</strong> and <strong>Off-Page</strong> optimisation,
          keyword research, SEO audits, content strategy, local and international SEO, link building, and digital PR.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m confident using tools including Ahrefs, SEMrush, Ubersuggest, Screaming Frog, Moz Pro, Majestic, BrightLocal, Lumar (DeepCrawl),
          SimilarWeb, GA4, Google Search Console, Google Tag Manager, Looker Studio, and Google Keyword Planner — alongside Lighthouse, GTmetrix,
          and PageSpeed Insights.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also use AI tools like ChatGPT-4o, Perplexity, and Claude to speed up research and ideation while keeping the strategy human and grounded.
        </p>
